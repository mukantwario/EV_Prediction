# Sales_Analysis
Analyzing sales data with focus on count-based data where each point is the number of events that have occurred over some fixed time unit t.
Data used are sales events during time unit t  like day, week, month and year. The event rate can change over time or from one observation to another. Here are some examples of such data:
number of sales in summer time is higher than other time of the year
number of sales in Npvember are high compared to other months, here we can think of black friday sales
number of sales for sunday are lower, most people takes sunday off and some business closes

From points above business owner can predict their sales and/or what to change to boost sales on non-productive time.
